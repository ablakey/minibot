# Minibot

I need to explain this more. But I made this readme to make some notes at 8am about the next few weeks.



## Development Plans


1. Confirm the Romi hardware survived my soldering skills.
    - Use the default demo code.

2. Try to replace some of the Python Pi code with Rust Pi code
    - No point. It's just part of the challenge: use Rust instead.
